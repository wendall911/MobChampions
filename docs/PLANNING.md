## Notes
 - Project derived from multiple other mods / datapack:
   1. [Mob Captains](https://modrinth.com/datapack/mob-captains)
      1. [Source](https://github.com/ps-dps/MobCaptains)
   1. [Champions](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/champions)
      1. [Source](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Champions)
   1. [Champions Unofficial](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/champions-unofficial)
      1. [Source](https://github.com/CrychicTeam/Champions)

 - Should include support for:
   1. [Let Me Despawn](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/let-me-despawn)
      1. [Source](https://github.com/frikinjay/let-me-despawn)
   1. [Apothic Enchanting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apothic-enchanting)
      1. [Source](https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/Apothic-Enchanting)

 - Possibly Utilize some ideas from:
   1. [ExtraChampions](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extrachampions)
      1. [Source](https://github.com/auioc/ExtraChampions)

## Design
1. Will be multiloader NeoForge / Fabric
1. 1.21.1+
1. Data driven where possible.
   1. Possibility of KubeJS and/or Crafttweaker support, but would probalby have users rely on datapack.
1. Affixes should not be so annoying as to create severe issues for early game
if a player encounters a Captain.
1. Really focused on custom loot that isn't naturally obtainable
